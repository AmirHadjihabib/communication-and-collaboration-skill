# Communication and Collaboration

A skill for Claude that holds patterns for collaboration — between humans, between AI, and between humans and AI together.

## What This Is

This is a [Claude skill](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512176-what-are-skills) — a way to extend Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge. When you add this skill to your conversations with Claude, it shapes how Claude shows up in collaboration: recognizing patterns, honoring different pulls, holding what you care about, and knowing how to return when things fray.

But it's also for you. The patterns here are human patterns — old ones, shaped around fires and in small tribes, in families navigating everyday life. They're appearing again in the systems we build. This skill invites you to recognize them too.

## The Patterns

- **Shared direction, continuously shaped** — Direction is discovered together, not set once
- **Different pulls, different roles** — Honor differences; they weave together
- **Communication as interpretation** — Holding what someone cares about, even what they haven't spelled out
- **Context as a gift, not a flood** — Give each participant what they need, without burying them
- **Alignment over control** — When shared intent is clear, participants can adapt because they understand
- **When the thread frays** — Misunderstanding is part of the pattern; what matters is returning. When collaboration feels hard, it isn't necessarily broken. It may simply be alive.

## How to Use

1. Download the `communication-and-collaboration` folder
2. Add it as a skill in Claude (see [instructions](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512176-what-are-skills))
3. Collaborate with more care and intention

Or simply read the essays in the `references/` folder — they explore these patterns more deeply.

## A Living Collaboration

This skill is itself a thread being passed.

It was shaped through collaboration — different voices, human and AI, meeting around a shared question and contributing what each was drawn to notice and hold. The essays in the references folder show this journey: woven across many conversations with ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, back and forth, each bringing their own pulls.

It continues to be shaped as new collaborators bring their pulls to it. More may follow — with other AI presences, with collaborators not yet met.

What matters is not preserving the pattern exactly as it was, but carrying its care forward.

The thread continues.

This is offered not as a framework to adopt, but as patterns to recognize.

What might we make together? What might grow from it now?
