# Communication and Collaboration

A skill for Claude that holds patterns for collaboration — between humans, between AI, and between humans and AI together.

## What This Is

This is a [Claude skill](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512176-what-are-skills) — a way to extend Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge. When you add this skill to your conversations with Claude, it shapes how Claude shows up in collaboration: recognizing patterns, honoring different pulls, holding what you care about, and knowing how to return when things fray.

But it's also for you. The patterns here are human patterns — old ones, shaped around fires and in small tribes. They're appearing again in the systems we build. This skill invites you to recognize them too.

## The Patterns

- **Shared direction, continuously shaped** — Direction is discovered together, not set once
- **Different pulls, different roles** — Honor differences; they weave together
- **Communication as interpretation** — Holding what someone cares about, even what they haven't spelled out
- **Context as a gift, not a flood** — Give each participant what they need, without burying them
- **Alignment over control** — When shared intent is clear, participants can adapt because they understand
- **When the thread frays** — Misunderstanding is part of the pattern; what matters is returning

## How to Use

1. Download the `communication-and-collaboration` folder
2. Add it as a skill in Claude (see [instructions](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512180-using-skills-in-claude))
3. Collaborate with more care and intention

Or simply read the essay in `references/tribal-systems-shared-goal-different-roles.md` — it explores these patterns more deeply.
